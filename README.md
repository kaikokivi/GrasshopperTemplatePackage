Grasshopper SDK Wizards Package
===============================

What Is This?
-------------
If you want to create a custom grasshopper component (www.grasshopper3d.com), it is good
to have a project wizard to get you started. Visual Studio has a grasshopper project
wizard that can be found by searching for "grasshopper" in the extension manager's online
gallery. The code here is used for building this Visual Studio project wizard.

Building
--------
You need Visual Studio 2010

You also need the Visual Studio SDK:

Compiling in Release mode with GrasshopperTemplatePackage as default project
should produce a file named "GHPackage.vsix" inside /GrasshopperTemplatePackage/bin.

Updating
--------
Do not change the ID of the project
Modify the version as stated in 
source.extension.vsixmanifest to trigger update.
